# üìß **Spam Classifier Project**

## üåü **Overview**
This project implements a **Spam Classifier** using machine learning to distinguish between spam and ham (not spam) SMS messages. The classifier processes raw text messages, converts them into numerical features, and uses a machine learning model to predict whether a message is spam or not. 

This project is built with:
- üîç **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing raw text data.
- üìä **Feature Extraction**: Converting text to numerical data with `CountVectorizer`.
- ü§ñ **Model Training and Evaluation**: Building and evaluating a classification model with robust metrics.

## üéØ **Project Features**
- ‚úÖ **Preprocessing**:
  - Remove special characters, numbers, and stopwords.
  - Convert all text to lowercase for uniformity.
  - Tokenize and vectorize the text using **Bag of Words** with `CountVectorizer`.
  
- ‚úÖ **Model Training**:
  - Train a machine learning model (e.g., Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression) on vectorized text data.
  
- ‚úÖ **Model Evaluation**:
  - Evaluate performance using metrics such as:
    - Accuracy
    - Precision
    - Recall
    - F1-score
  - Generate a detailed **classification report**.

- ‚úÖ **Interactive Notebook**:
  - Step-by-step walkthrough in a Jupyter Notebook format.

## üìÇ **Dataset**
- **Name**: SMS Spam Collection Dataset
- **Description**: The dataset contains labeled SMS messages (`spam` or `ham`).
- **Structure**:
  - `label`: Indicates if the message is `spam` or `ham`.
  - `sms_message`: The text of the message.
  
### Example:
| **Label** | **SMS Message**                  |
|-----------|----------------------------------|
| ham       | "Hi, how are you?"              |
| spam      | "You‚Äôve won $1000! Claim now!"  |

## üõ†Ô∏è **How It Works**
1. **Data Loading**:
   - Load the dataset using Pandas.
   - Split data into training and testing sets.
2. **Text Preprocessing**:
   - Clean, tokenize, and vectorize the text.
3. **Model Training**:
   - Train a machine learning model on the training set.
4. **Predictions**:
   - Use the trained model to predict the labels of the test set.
5. **Evaluation**:
   - Compare predictions to true labels and calculate metrics.

## üìà **Performance Metrics**
The model is evaluated on:
- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness of predictions.
- **Precision**: Percentage of predicted spam messages that are truly spam.
- **Recall**: Percentage of actual spam messages that are correctly identified.
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.

## üñ•Ô∏è **Usage**

### Prerequisites:
- Python (>=3.7)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
  ```

### Steps to Run:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/spam-classifier.git
   cd spam-classifier
   ```
2. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Spam_Classifier.ipynb
   ```
3. Follow the steps in the notebook to:
   - Load and preprocess the data.
   - Train the model.
   - Evaluate the performance.

## üöÄ **Results and Insights**
- The model successfully classifies most spam and ham messages.
- **Key Insight**: Words like "free", "win", and "urgent" are strong indicators of spam.
